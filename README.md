# Help Call App - application to help volunteers help.

Rest backend application using **SQL database**, using **CRUD HTTP methods**. Using 8080 port. Frontend application based on Vaadin.

The purpose of the application was to connect volunteers with people in need of help. The application was to become a response to the ever greater anonymisation of the society and integrate local support groups. I'm still developing it.
